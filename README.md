 ## My Task
 My task as a developer was to create a page that I could enter in a city and get different criteria about the weather there and the next five days.
 
 ## User Story
 AS A user that lives in a city with weather I WANT to be able to look up my forcast and days in the future SO THAT I can better plan and prepare for what it is like outside.
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria
 GIVEN I need to look up my weather
 WHEN I type in the name of my city
 THEN I should have my city pull up with the forcast
 WHEN I look at my citys focast
 THEN I will see the next five days forcast
 WHEN I want to know what the high temperature will be
 THEN I will see the high today, and for the next five days
